# Book Club
This application that lets you talk with AI about a book or text you are reading, simulating a book club! You simply upload a pdf or txt file and can then ask questions about it and receive responses!
## Example
When entering "Book Club", the user has the option to either discuss a new book, or discuss one that has been previously discussed. Every time a new book is uploaded, the text is chunked and vectorized using Open AI's Embbeding API and stored using Chroma. The user can upload txt files or pdfs, in which case OCR is used to determine the text. If the user decides to discuss a book that has been discussed before, the application will locate that book's vector database, which is stored locally. \

Next, the user will be prompted to ask a question in Book Club! This question will then serve as the query for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with the book text as the knowledge base. First, a similarity search will be performed with the vectorized query and the vector database of embedded text chunks. The top four chunks of relevance (highest cosine similarity score) will be retrieved from the database and used as context in prompting Open AI's gpt-3.5-turbo model. Finally, the model will be fed the initial query, context, and in the future, conversation history, so the model can serve as a Book Club member!

To somewhat measure performance on the first book of Harry Potter, fifteen questions from Sparknote's comprehension quiz were asked: https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/harrypotter/quiz/. Of these questions, Book Club fully answered 14. It failed to fully answer, "Who actually cursed Harry Potter during his Quidditch match", incorrectly offering Snape as the response. This is likely because the book paints Snape as the perpetrator for much of the book, with Quirrel being revealed as the true perpetrator onky towards the end, skewing the context received by the model. Adjustments to how the context is delivered to the model will have to made to adjust for this - perhaps weighting position (beginning v. end of the book) when determining the source of truth. \
## Improvements
The next steps will be to incorporate conversation history for Book Club, so it can remember previous conversations about a certain book. Furthermore, I will be implementing a "No Spoilers" feature, in which the user can specify where in the book they (in natural language or using concrete descriptors like page number or chapter), and have the similarity search only retrieve chunks from parts that the user has read. Finally, I will be implementing a UI that is much friendlier to use than the terminal!
